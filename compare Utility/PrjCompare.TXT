The cab file for your application has been built as 'D:\vbstuff\compare Utility\Package\PrjCompare.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (D:\vbstuff\compare Utility\Package\Support\PrjCompare.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
